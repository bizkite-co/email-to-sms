# Implement Email to SMS Notification System - Task 1

This task is the first step in implementing the Email to SMS Notification System as outlined in [plan.md](plan.md).

**Objective:** Initialize a new AWS CDK project in the `/home/mstouffer/repos/email-to-sms` directory.

**Steps:**

1.  Open a terminal in the `/home/mstouffer/repos/email-to-sms` directory.
2.  Run the appropriate `cdk init` command for TypeScript to create a new CDK application. Refer to the AWS CDK documentation for the exact command if needed.
3.  Review the created project structure and files.

Once the project is initialized, the next task will be to define the S3 bucket for approved senders.
